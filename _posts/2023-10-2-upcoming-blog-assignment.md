title: Upcoming Blog Post Assignment
author: Bruno Zhong

Two weeks ago, I joined Brookfield Academy's Club Tome. In case you don't know what Club Tome is, it's a reading club for grades 2 to 5. This year's topic is called "Brave on Purpose", and Club Tome's slogan is "There's no place like Tome."

Club Tome also has a blog post assignment, and Yogesh and I are going to do it. The other assignments include a vlog assignment, a book cover redesign assignment, and many more! I am looking forward to it, as long as it isn't about *The Green Ember*, which is boring. If it was about *The Green Ember*, it will probably look like this:

> Today we are going to review *The Green Ember*. Don't get your hopes up for this, because it's a boring book. Anyways, let's begin.
>
> *The Green Ember* starts with two rabbits playing Starseek, but when they get to a zone where their parents forbid them to go, misfortune spreads. I don't know how somebody managed to notice as soon as they entered the zone, but the whole story seems like it was set up by someone.
>
> Do not read, even if you might see high reviews.

I hope the blog post will be intresting; otherwise, it may go into the fate of being deleted.
