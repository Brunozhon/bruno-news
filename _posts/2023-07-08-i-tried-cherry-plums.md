The cherry plum, also known as the *Prunus cerasifera*, is like a delicious big cherry. It is sweet and tangy and it contains less sugar than many other fruits according to [Minneopa Orchards](https://minnetonkaorchards.com/cherry-plums/)! But the cherry plant has more to show.

## Cherry Plant Trees

Unfortunately, the cherry plum tree lives a relatively short life, because it can get pests and diesease easily. On average, these poor trees only live twenty years! That's about the time you take to finish school.

But let's move on swiftly from the bad news to the good news. Cherry plum trees are resistant to drought.

If that's the only good news, how about the facts? They grow best in loamy, acidic soil, but if your soil has a bit too much sand or clay, the cherry plum plant can still tolerate it.
