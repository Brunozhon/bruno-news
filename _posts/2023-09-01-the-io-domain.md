title: The IO Domain - Why Is It Referred to Gaming?
author: Bruno Zhong

When you hear something end in `.io`, you usually think of a game, such as [Slither.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slither.io) or [Surviv.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviv.io). Well, today I will dig down into the web and find out why `.io` is referred to gaming!

## `.io` is for British *I*ndian *O*cean Territory

`.io` was assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory, but like `.bz` and `.me`, 99% are not used for the country code they were assigned to.

## Footnotes

<ol>
  <li id="one">No, I don't know what tribunal means. I think 99% of people would be able to read on without knowing that "tribunal" means, so I'm not going to waste precious time that otherwise could be used for researching the <code>.io</code> domain.</li>
</ol>
